# Transferability of single-image super resolution to geophysical downscaling

This is a reference implementation of geographical downscaling using super resolution, intended for use in the climate sciences domain. This code supports the paper " "Transferability of single-image super resolution to geophysical downscaling" - Zhongyang Hu, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Stef Lhermitte, Yao Sun, Brice NoÃ«l, Melchior van Wessem, Lichao Mou, and Xiao Xiang Zhu. 2022.

## Framework

[1] Preprocessing RACMO2 27 km and 5.5 km Simulations using Preprocessing_main.py

    -> 1. Cropping and coregistrating RACMO2 27 and 5.5 km resolution (including data NetCDF to Geo Tiff and AOI partitioning)
    -> 2. Generating Training, development, testing data sets

More details can be found in Preprocessing_RACMO2.py

[2] Training Super Resolution Models using train_main.py

    e.g., python train.py SRResNet ALL_MASE ALL 3 T T 16 2 F T 1e-5 0
    
    usage: train.py [-h] SR_Model LOSS_Mode AOIs Numver_of_Input_Variables Write_NPY Plot_NPY Batch_Size Training_Padding Standization Save_Format MD Embedding_Dim model_version

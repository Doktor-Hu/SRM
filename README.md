# Transferability of single-image super resolution to geophysical downscaling

This is a reference implementation of geographical downscaling using super resolution, intended for use in the climate sciences domain. This code supports the paper " "Transferability of single-image super resolution to geophysical downscaling" - Zhongyang Hu, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Stef Lhermitte, Yao Sun, Brice NoÃ«l, Melchior van Wessem, Lichao Mou, and Xiao Xiang Zhu. 2022.
